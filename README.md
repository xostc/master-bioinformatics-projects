# Master Bioinformatics Projects

## Overview  
This repository contains a collection of bioinformatics projects developed during the Master's program. Each project is organized in its own folder and may include scripts and files in various formats such as `.py`, `.html`, `.R`, `.bas`, or `.pdf`.

## Contents  
- Projects organized in separate directories  
- File formats include Python scripts, R scripts, HTML reports, batch files, and PDFs  
- Topics cover data visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, genomic data processing, and bioinformatics tools

## How to Use  
Browse the folders to find the project of interest. Open the corresponding files with the appropriate software:

- `.py`: Python scripts, run with Python interpreter  
- `.R`: R scripts, run with R or RStudio  
- `.html`: Web reports, open in a web browser  
- `.bas`: Batch files for command line operations  
- `.pdf`: Documentation and reports, open with any PDF reader

## Requirements  
Depending on the project, you may need:

- Python 3.x and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Biopython  
- R and relevant packages  
- Conda environment recommended for managing dependencies
